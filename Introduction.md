# Final project: Prediction of the Happiness Index for Elderly People in China


#### Yifan Qu, Xi Zou

### Background:

As the most populous nation in the world, China also has the largest elderly population. 

In 2017, in China, the proportion of Chinese citizens above 60 years old obtained 17.3 percent, approximately above 241 million. It is expected that China's 65-year-old population will reach 487 million, or nearly 35 percent in 2050.

The increase in the elderly population makes the issue of old-age care one of the focuses of Chinese academic research. But at present, most of the domestic research in China focuses on the old-age care model and structure, and there are relatively few studies on the well-being of the elderly.

Therefore, we tried to build a model to predict the happiness index of the elderly using the CHARLS(2015)


### Data

The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) aims to collect a high quality nationally representative sample of Chinese residents ages 45 and older to serve the needs of scientific research on the elderly. 

Here, we use the latest version of the data (2015). All data forms are the Stata dataset.
